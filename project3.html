  <h2>About this Project</h2>
  <h3>For this assignment, I analyzed a Harpers Bazaar magazine cover to demonstrate the application of core design principles, including alignment, contrast, balance, proximity, repetition, and space. I deconstructed the layout, highlighting how the designer’s use of these principles created an aesthetically pleasing and functional design. This exercise involved placing the cover in a document and annotating it with detailed descriptions to guide viewers through the key elements that make it an example of effective design.
